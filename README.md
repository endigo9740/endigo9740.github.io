# Endigo Design - Revision 8

The portfolio of Chris Simmons.

### About

Over the course of 15+ years Iâ€™ve built a career focusing on development, design, and UX for a wide variety of technology and fields. However, in my free time I can be found exploring Dallas, tinkering with technology and video games, catching the latest films at Alamo Drafthouse, or catching up on a few of my favorite streams on Twitch.
